# Assignment 1 (Module 1)

## Building a Weather Application

### Objective:

Build a weather application that retrieves and displays the current weather information for a given location. The
application should utilize HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

### Requirements:

#### Design and layout:

Create an HTML file named index.html that includes the necessary HTML structure.
Use Bootstrap to create a responsive design for the application.
Apply appropriate CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the application.

#### Weather API integration:

Sign up for a free API key from a weather service provider of your choice (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).
Write JavaScript code in a separate file named script.js to handle API integration.
Implement a function named getWeatherData that takes a location as a parameter and retrieves the current weather
information using the API.
Display the weather information (e.g., temperature, description, humidity) on the web page using JavaScript.

#### User interaction:

Create an input field where the user can enter a location (e.g., city name, ZIP code).
Implement a button that triggers the retrieval of weather information for the entered location.
Update the displayed weather information dynamically when the user enters a new location.

#### Additional features:

Utilize arrow functions, template literals, let, const, object literal changes, spread operator, destructuring, default
parameters, for/in, and for/of loops in your JavaScript code as appropriate.
Implement error handling for failed API requests or invalid user input.
Add any additional features or enhancements to the application that you think would be valuable.

#### Submission:

Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Commit and push your code to the repository.
Deploy your project on Netlify or any other similar hosting service.
Create a note.txt file within your GitHub repository.
In the note.txt file, provide the deployed version link of your application.
Submit your assignment by sharing the GitHub repository link.
